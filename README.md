# Segmentation Exercise

In this exercise, you are asked to showcase your analytic and segmentation prowess. It is Tuesday morning and it’s your third month in your new role. Your Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing comes to you and asks you where they should focus the company’s marketing resources next year. After speaking with a few colleagues you quickly discover that Marketing is faced with a finite budget and a large customer base. You also learn that a number of division presidents attempted to increase revenue through cross-sell efforts in the past with minimal success. Meanwhile, the marketing team is looking for insight to maximize their targeting efforts. Your conversations has led you to few preliminary hypotheses. 

Before you provide feedback to your SVP early next week, you decide to conduct a quick segmentation exercise to validate your hypotheses.
and proceed by asking the Finance Analyst to provide you data of past sales performance. The data is
located in the `sales` directory:

* `SalesByMonth.csv` are monthly invoiced amount in $ dollar by subscribers and products, i.e. __SKU__
* `sku.csv` is a list of products, the business divisions managing the products and whether the product is sold in bulk __B__ or as single unit __T__
* `subscriber.csv` is a list of subscriber and the types of subscribers.  The types of subscribers are subscriber classifications manually assigned by the customer management team during the on-boarding process.

After a quick scan, you feel good that you can answer your preliminary hypotheses. However, during your scan of the data, you notice a few problems and must determine how to address this during your analysis.

Please include the following in your presentation:

- Discuss your hypotheses and assumptions

- Your segmentation approach

- Potential cross-sell opportunities
